<section>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to Formula Countdown ("we," "our," or "us").
        This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about the collection, use, and protection of your information
        when you use our mobile application and services ("App").
    </p>
    <p>
        By accessing or using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
        If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h1>1. Information We Collect</h1>
    <p>
        Apple Analytics: Our App utilizes Apple's analytics services to collect anonymized and aggregated information
        about App usage, performance, and user engagement. This information helps us understand how users interact
        with the App and improve its functionality.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>2. Use of Information</h1>
    <p>
        We use the information collected through Apple Analytics for the sole purpose of improving the App's
        performance, user experience, and overall functionality. We do not collect or process any third-party data,
        and we do not use location services.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>3. Security</h1>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through Apple Analytics from unauthorized
        access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely
        secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>4. Your Choices</h1>
    <p>
        As the App does not collect personal information directly and only utilizes Apple Analytics, you have limited
        options for data control. You can manage your device settings related to the App and control the sharing of
        analytics data with Apple.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>5. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. The latest version will be posted on the App,
        and the effective date will be indicated.
    </p>
